# Section 1: Programming Challenges (PHP)

See Programming Challenges - PHP. 

If PHP has been installed, all three tasks can be run from the command line e.g: `php run task1.php`

- [Task 1](Programming_Challenges_PHP/task1.php)
- [Task 2](Programming_Challenges_PHP/task2.php)
- [Task 3](Programming_Challenges_PHP/task3.php)

# Section 2: Creating and Designing APIs (PHP)


# Section 3: Working with Database queries (PHP).

For these exercises I 'invented' in my mind a schema to work with. 

These were written with PostgreSQL in mind.

- [Task 1](Working_With_Database_Queries_PHP/task1.sql)
- [Task 2](Working_With_Database_Queries_PHP/task2.sql)
- [Task 3](Working_With_Database_Queries_PHP/task3.sql)


# Section 4: Building APIS (Laravel)



# Automated Testing (Laravel)

I built these into laravel, with some basic boiler plate to get them running. Both tasks 1 and 3 can be found in [laravel-sample/tests/Feature/ProductTest.php](laravel-sample/tests/Feature/ProductTest.php)

I skipped task 2 due to time constraints. The set up time to get a Dusk environment running appeared potentially (possibly incorrectly) finicky. 

- [Task 1](Automated_Testing_Laravel/task1.php)
- [Task 3](Automated_Testing_Laravel/task3.php)


# Automated infrastructure Setup (Laravel)

It was difficult to think of a good way to present Task 1 and 2, so I decided to take the approach of a quick guide. I used a slightly different approach for both.

- [Task 1](Automating_Infrastructure_Setup_Laravel/task1.md)
- [Task 2](Automating_Infrastructure_Setup_Laravel/task2.md)


# Database Schema and Seeding (Laravel)

As with Automated testing, I built these directly into the laravel sample and they can be seen in the migration and seeder directories respectively:

- [laravel-sample/database/migrations](laravel-sample/database/migrations)
- [laravel-sample/database/seeders](laravel-sample/database/seeders)



- [Task 1 - split out from Laravel](Database_Schema_and_Seeding_Laravel/task1.php)
- [Task 2 - split out from Laravel](Database_Schema_and_Seeding_Laravel/task2.php)
- [Task 3 - split out from Laravel - The Seeder](Database_Schema_and_Seeding_Laravel/task3-seeder.php)
- [Task 3 - split out from Laravel - The Factory](Database_Schema_and_Seeding_Laravel/task3-factory.php)
