# Drafting an endpoint to return all product details from the products table.

I'll use much of the same process and thought process as in 'Creating and designing APIs - PHP'.

- *Api Type:* Rest
- *Endpoint path*: /api/poducts
- *unique identifier:* n/a - this is a fetch all endpoint
- *Structure:* [See the OpenAPI definition in (openapi.yml)](openapi.yml)**
- *Where / how will it be built:* As per the task, this will be in Laravel.

I've created a redumentary version of this endpoint in the sample laravel application here in @TODO. Of note, I have not implemented any security or authentication.
